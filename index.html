    <h1>Shawna Ogonek | Elementary School Librarian</h1>
    <h2><i>Welcome to my website dedicated to supporting student learning & Providing Teachers/Librarians with helpful Resources</i></h2>

    <p><a href="#contact-section">Jump to Contact Info</a></p>

    <p>
      I am an aspiring school librarian who is <em>desperately</em> searching for reliable and applicable resources that help my students learn and grow. I hope you join me on my journey while I navigate my first few years as a school librarian.  
    </p>  

    <p> 
      This website will be dedicated to <b>children's literature, information literacy, digital literacy, and the ethical use of information.</b><br>
      I am <strong>no expert</strong>, but I hope we can share resources and ideas to better each other. This website will be dedicated to all of the knowledge and resources I accumulate on my way.
    </p>
	<p>
  As a school librarian, my goal is to create a welcoming and inclusive space where every student feels encouraged to explore, imagine, and grow. Whether you're searching for your next favorite book, researching a new topic, or learning how to use technology responsibly, the library is here to support you every step of the way. Let's make learning an adventure!
</p>
<p>
  In the library, we celebrate curiosity, creativity, and the joy of lifelong learning. From storytime and book clubs to digital projects and research help, there's something here for everyone. I believe every student has a voice and a story worth telling.
</p>
<p>
  In today’s connected world, digital citizenship is more important than ever. In our library, we guide students to use technology ethically, evaluate online sources critically, and communicate responsibly. By fostering strong digital literacy skills, we empower young learners to navigate the internet safely and respectfully.
</p>
<p>
  Collaboration is at the heart of our library community. Whether it’s working together on group research projects, sharing book recommendations in club meetings, or co-creating digital presentations, students learn the value of teamwork and collective problem-solving. Our space is designed to inspire cooperation and creativity.
</p>
<p>
  Strong partnerships between librarians and teachers enrich the learning experience for everyone. I collaborate with classroom teachers to develop curriculum-aligned book lists, integrate information literacy lessons into subject areas, and co-plan engaging activities. Together, we ensure that every lesson is backed by the right resources and expertise.
